# Illustrator native records

A `.ai` file carries two copies of the artwork. One is the PDF page that every
other application reads. The other is Illustrator's own copy, which it reads and
everyone else ignores. This page describes that own copy and how much of it
PROOF can read. It is the shared reference for PROOF's native reader and its
native `.ai` writer ([AI interchange](PROOF-ai-interchange.md)).

## Where the records are

| File | Where |
|---|---|
| PDF-based `.ai` (Illustrator 9 and later) | Page 1's `/PieceInfo /Illustrator /Private` streams `AIPrivateData1…N`, joined |
| Illustrator EPS | After `%%EOF`, between `%AI9_PrivateDataBegin` and `%AI9_PrivateDataEnd` |
| PostScript `.ai` (Illustrator 8 and older) | The file itself |

The joined streams may start with plain header comments and a thumbnail. After
that comes `%AI12_CompressedData` followed by zlib (CS2 to CC 2019), or
`%AI24_ZStandard_Data` followed by Zstandard (2020 and later). Older files keep
plain records. The marker can be more than 4 KB into the data, so search the
whole data for it. Illustrator pads Zstandard frames with zeros.

## The records

The records are a PostScript-dialect program. Nothing in them has to be
executed. A reader tokenizes them and acts on a fixed table of operators.

- **Lines starting with `%_`** are tokens hidden from a PostScript interpreter.
  They hold Illustrator-only data, such as the object behind a drawn look,
  object dictionaries and mask art.
- **Other `%` lines** are section markers, such as `%AI5_BeginLayer`.
- **Dictionaries are written postfix:**
  - `/Type :` opens one.
  - `values /ValueType (Key) ,` adds an entry.
  - `;` closes it.
- **Image samples** follow `%%BeginData: n` and `XI`.

The **coordinate space** is the art space, with y pointing up. The first
artboard's top-left corner is PROOF's origin. See the writer recipe in
[AI interchange](PROOF-ai-interchange.md) for the canvas and `%AI3_TemplateBox`
arithmetic.

### Operator table

Unless the "Source" column says otherwise, the meanings come from VectorCraft's
reader (`crates/eps/src/import/ai/` at `4cf912f`, MIT OR Apache-2.0). Rows marked
**census** were worked out from real files on 2026-10-09 (see below).

| Operators | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `%AI5_BeginLayer`, `… Lb`, `(name) Ln`, `LB` | Layer. The `Lb` operands are: 0 visible, 1 preview, 2 unlocked, 3 printing, 4 dimmed, 7 colour index, 8–10 RGB, 12 dim %. | VectorCraft |
| `u`…`U`, `*u`…`*U`, `q`…`Q` | Group, compound path, clip group. `W` makes the next path clip. | VectorCraft |
| `m l L c C v V y Y h H` | Path construction. | VectorCraft |
| `N n F f S s B b` | Paint: none, fill, stroke, both. The lower-case forms close the path. `(op) *` paints a guide. | VectorCraft |
| `w J j M d`, `XR` | Stroke width, cap, join, miter limit and dash; fill rule (1 means even-odd). | VectorCraft |
| `O`, `R` | Overprint the fill or the stroke. | VectorCraft |
| `Xw`, `A` | Hidden, locked. | VectorCraft |
| `mode opacity isolate knockout shape Xy` | Transparency. The modes run Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light, Color Dodge, Color Burn, Darken, Lighten, Difference, Exclusion, Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity. After a group closes, it applies to the group. | VectorCraft |
| `n (style) XW` | Style marker. `1` means the object's drawn look came first and the object itself follows on `%_` lines. | VectorCraft |
| `/ArtDictionary : … ;` | Follows an object. `AIArtName`, or `AI10_ArtUID` (an XML id: `_` is a space, `_xHH_` an escaped character), gives its name. `BBAccumRotation` is the turned box's angle. | VectorCraft; angle from PROOF's transform-box work |
| `g`/`G` | Grey, where 1 is white. | VectorCraft |
| `k`/`K` | CMYK. | VectorCraft |
| `Xa`/`XA` | RGB: `c m y k r g b`, where the CMYK values are its equivalent. | VectorCraft |
| `x`/`X` | Named CMYK colour: `c m y k (name) tint`. **Tint 0 is the full colour.** | VectorCraft |
| `Xx`/`XX` | Spot colour: `c m y k v1 v2 v3 (name) tint type`. Type 0 is CMYK, 1 is RGB, and **2 is Lab, where v1–v3 are L, a, b**. PANTONE swatches use type 2. | **census**. VectorCraft reads type 2 as CMYK and loses the Lab definition. |
| `Xk`/`XK` | **Global process colour**, in the same layout as `Xx`. Type 0 is CMYK with 6 numbers; type 1 is RGB with 9. | **census** (blocked about 200 of 877 files under VectorCraft's table) |
| `Xs`/`XS` | Registration: `c m y k ([Registration]) tint`. | **census**. VectorCraft ignores `Xs`, so Registration fills keep the previous fill. |
| `Xz`/`XZ` | Registration, in the `Xx` layout. | **census** |
| `(name) type n Bd` … `Bs` … `BD` | Gradient definition. Each stop is `colour style [opacity 6] midpoint ramp Bs`. The styles are 0 grey, 1 CMYK, 2 RGB with CMYK, 3 and 4 named. | VectorCraft |
| `[flag] Bb`, `Bg`, `Bm`, `Bh`, `BB` | Gradient on an object: name, origin, angle, length, matrix and focal point. | VectorCraft |
| `%AI5_BeginRaster`, `/Space XN`, `[m] … w h bits type alpha … XI` | Embedded image. The samples stay in their colour space; CMYK is common. | VectorCraft |
| `/AI11Text : /StoryIndex …` | Text object. Its text lives in `%AI11_BeginTextDocument`. | VectorCraft |
| `n Ar` | The old Attributes panel's output resolution (300, 800). No visual effect. | **census** |
| `1 An` | CS5 only, after every object. Almost certainly *Align to Pixel Grid*. No visual effect. | **census** |
| `(hex) Xt n XD` | Brush metadata inside drawn looks, with n running 0–4. No geometry or paint. | **census** |
| `Ae AE Ap As Xd Xr XG Xh XH XF D X= X+ Bc Xm XP Np TE TZ Xt Xi XI ` LB2 Lc Xv XV Xq XQ Xg Xn Bn` | Ignored by VectorCraft. | VectorCraft |

### Not read yet (the file opens from its PDF page)

| Feature | Records | Files (of 877) |
|---|---|---|
| Gradient mesh | `/Mesh X!` … `/End X!`, with `value /Key X#` pairs (Version, Type, Size, the patch data) | 11 |
| Pattern fills | `p`/`P` | 15 |
| Placed (linked) files | `%AI5_BeginPlace` … `%AI5_EndPlace`, with a `~` inside | 6 |
| Symbols | `/SymbolInstance` | 2 |
| Opacity masks | `/Mask : (Clipping) (Inverted) (Disabled) (Linked) ,` inside the masked object's ArtDictionary, with the mask art on `%_` lines | 3 in `Typical.ai` |

**VectorCraft drops opacity masks silently.** It discards art built inside a
dictionary, so a masked group comes in unmasked, without an error. PROOF must
read masks or refuse the native path for them. More generally, reading without
an error is not the same as reading faithfully. The importer compares its
render with the PDF page and uses the page when they differ.

## Census of real files (2026-10-09)

`tools/ai-census.py` decodes the records and walks them with one of two tables:
VectorCraft's (`--rules vectorcraft`) or PROOF's extended one (`--rules proof`).
It never executes anything, and duplicates are counted once. It runs only on
approved sources (see `APPROVED` in the script), because some production files
are under NDA.

The corpus has **877 unique files** from Illustrator CS3 to 2025. They are mostly
illustration and print work. The five `spike/files` test files are among them,
and so is a released 2020–2023 hospital job.

| | Reads fully native |
|---|---|
| VectorCraft's table | 589 of 877 (67%); 2 of the 5 spike files |
| PROOF's table | **839 of 877 (95.7%)**; all 5 spike files |

`Xk` alone kept 2 of the 5 spike files and most of the 2020–2023 files from
VectorCraft's table. Under that table, the hospital job read 15 of 44 files;
under PROOF's, it reads 43.

| Version | Files | PROOF | VectorCraft |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CS3 | 9 | 9 | 4 |
| CS5 | 281 | 277 | 201 |
| CS6 | 71 | 70 | 59 |
| CC | 113 | 112 | 66 |
| CC 2014 | 35 | 33 | 23 |
| CC 2015 / 2015.3 | 144 | 130 | 106 |
| CC 2017 | 110 | 108 | 78 |
| 2019–2021 | 32 | 31 | 24 |
| 2022–2023 | 64 | 57 | 21 |
| 2025 | 14 | 12 | 7 |

The remaining 38 files are:
- the features in the table above: meshes 11, pattern fills 15, placed files 6
  and symbols 2
- three files whose records decode past the 256 MB limit
- one file whose groups don't nest (`Q` without `q`)
- one file whose image data isn't delimited

The census also shows how common these features are:
- transparency in 700 files
- drawn looks in 503 (objects with several fills or strokes, effects or brushes)
- spot or global colours in 248
- overprint in 97
- text in 67
- embedded images in 56, 46 of them CMYK
- hidden objects in 38
- hidden layers in 16

Every file had layers and a `/Document` dictionary.

## PROOF's reader (2026-10-09)

`src/extension/internal/ai/ai-native-lexer.{h,cpp}` and
`ai-native-reader.{h,cpp}` contain the scanner and the reader. The operator
meanings are ported from VectorCraft, with the MIT notice in
`LICENSES/MIT-VectorCraft.txt`. The reader produces plain structures in art space:
- layers with their options
- groups, compound paths and clipping groups
- paths with fills, strokes, overprint and transparency
- inks
- gradients
- images, with their samples kept as stored (CMYK stays CMYK)
- text slots
- artboards and the art-to-document matrix

Beyond the VectorCraft port:
- **The palette is read.** `%AI5_BeginPalette` registers each swatch's ink with
  its kind (`Xx` spot, `Xk` global process) and its Lab or RGB definition, used
  or not. A gradient stop names its colour only in CMYK form, so it links to the
  swatch of that name. Otherwise a global process colour used only in a gradient
  would become a spot plate.
- **Lab spot definitions are kept** (`Xx` type 2).
- **Registration** is read (`Xs`/`XS`, `Xz`/`XZ`).
- **Opacity masks fail closed.** A `/Mask` that isn't disabled sends the file
  to the page instead of being dropped silently.
- **Census operators are ignored on purpose:** `Ar`, `An`, `XD`.

A gradient on an object is written as the path, then `Bb` (no operands), `Bg`,
optional `Bm`/`Bh`, then the paint operator (`f`), then `BB`. The paint uses the
instance, and `BB` paints nothing. One instance can hold two `Bm` matrices; the
last one wins. That still has to be checked against the page.

`testfiles/src/ai-native-reader-test.cpp` covers each operator row with
hand-written records, plus fail-closed cases, hostile input and limits. With
`PROOF_AI_CORPUS` set to `;`-separated folders of approved files, its corpus
case reads every file and prints which ones read natively.

**Decoder fixes** in `pdfinput/ai-private-data.cpp`, found by the census:
- **The compression marker** was looked for only at byte 0. CS-era files keep a
  plain header and thumbnail before `%AI12_CompressedData`, so they were treated
  as uncompressed, and `.ai` swatch libraries from them read nothing.
- **Zstandard decoding** stopped after the first frame. It could also stop while
  the decoder still held output, after the last input. Both would truncate the
  records silently. It now reads every frame, skips Illustrator's zero padding,
  and drains the decoder.

## Plan

1. **Native reader** (`src/extension/internal/ai/`), in progress. It covers the operator table
   above, is bounded, and fails closed. It produces a structure (layers, objects,
   inks, gradients, images, artboards) for both the importer and round-trip tests
   of the writer.
2. **Native import.** It builds the PROOF document from that structure:
   - CMYK colours and spot inks stay exact.
   - Lab alternates are kept.
   - CMYK images keep their samples.
   - Hidden objects and layers come in hidden.

   Drawn looks come in as groups. Text slots get point type (next step). The
   render is compared with the PDF page, and the page is used whenever they
   differ or anything is unread.
3. **Point type** from the text document, with VectorCraft's `ate.rs` as reference.
4. **Writer** extensions, in this order: gradients, images, text. They use the
   same tables, and the reader checks the writer's output alongside Illustrator.
